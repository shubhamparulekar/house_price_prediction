# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This is a personal machine learning project focused on predicting house prices based on historical data. The goal is to understand how various factors influence property prices and to build regression models that can make accurate predictions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this project is to:

- Explore and clean housing datasets
- Identify key factors affecting house prices
- Build and evaluate multiple regression models
- Use the best-performing model to predict property values

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating machine learning models

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhamparulekar/house_price_prediction.git
cd house_price_prediction
````

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Launch the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
```

Then follow along with the notebook cells to run the complete workflow — from data cleaning to final predictions.

## 📊 Project Workflow

* Load and inspect the dataset
* Handle missing values and outliers
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Encode categorical features
* Normalize or scale numerical data
* Train regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
* Evaluate using R² Score, MAE, and RMSE
* Select and test the best model

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Size, location, and number of bedrooms are often strong indicators of price
* Outliers and missing data can significantly affect predictions
* Visualizing data distributions reveals trends and relationships that guide feature selection
* Ensemble models (like Random Forest) tend to perform better in terms of generalization
